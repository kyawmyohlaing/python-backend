5. **User Experience**: Reduced complexity for users by providing a simple, unified interface for backups

## Usage Instructions

Users can now create database backups using any of these methods:

1. **Using Makefile (Recommended)**:
   ```bash
   make backup
   ```

2. **Direct Script Execution**:
   - Linux/Mac: `chmod +x backup_once.sh && ./backup_once.sh`
   - Windows: `backup_once.bat`

3. **Scheduled Backups**:
   - Linux/Mac: Using cron
   - Windows: Using Task Scheduler

All backups are saved in the `backups/` directory with timestamped filenames for easy identification.
