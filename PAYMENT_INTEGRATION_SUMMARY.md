# Payment Integration Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the payment functionality that was integrated into the FastAPI backend restaurant management system. The implementation provides comprehensive support for multiple payment methods with proper validation, processing, and reporting capabilities.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Payment Types Support

The system supports five different payment methods:

| Payment Type | API Value | Description |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| Cash | `cash` | Physical cash payments |
| Credit/Debit Card | `card` | Credit or debit card payments |
| QR Code | `qr` | QR code payment methods |
| Electronic Wallet | `e_wallet` | Digital wallet payments (e.g., PayPal, Apple Pay) |
| Gift Card | `gift_card` | Gift card payments |

### 2. Database Models

#### Order Model (`app/models/order.py`)
- Added `PaymentType` enum with all supported payment methods
- Added `payment_type` field to the Order model as an Enum column with default value `PaymentType.CASH`
- Added additional payment-related fields:
  - `payment_status`: String field to track payment status
  - `paid_at`: DateTime field to record when payment was processed
  - `payment_reference`: String field for external payment references
  - `refund_status`: String field to track refund status
  - `refunded_at`: DateTime field to record when refund was processed

#### Invoice Model (`app/models/invoice.py`)
- Added `payment_type` field to the Invoice model as a String column with default value `"cash"`

### 3. API Schemas

#### Order Schemas (`app/schemas/order_schema.py`)
- Added `payment_type` field to `OrderBase` schema with default value `"cash"`
- Added `payment_type` field to `OrderUpdate` schema as optional

#### Invoice Schemas (`app/schemas/invoice_schema.py`)
- Added `payment_type` field to `InvoiceBase` schema with default value `"cash"`
- Added `payment_type` field to `InvoiceUpdate` schema as optional

#### Payment Schemas (`app/schemas/payment_schema.py`)
- Created new schemas for payment processing:
  - `PaymentProcessRequest`/`PaymentProcessResponse`
  - `RefundProcessRequest`/`RefundProcessResponse`
  - `PaymentSummaryRequest`/`PaymentSummaryResponse`

### 4. Services

#### Payment Service (`app/services/payment_service.py`)
A dedicated service class that handles all payment-related operations:

- **Payment Processing**: Process payments for orders with validation
- **Refund Processing**: Handle refunds for paid orders
- **Payment Validation**: Validate payment types against supported methods
- **Payment Summary**: Generate payment statistics and reports
- **Payment Method Information**: Provide details about supported payment methods

### 5. API Routes

#### Payment Routes (`app/routes/payment_routes.py`)
RESTful API endpoints for payment operations:

- `POST /api/payments/process` - Process a payment for an order
- `POST /api/payments/refund` - Process a refund for a paid order
- `GET /api/payments/methods` - Get available payment methods
- `POST /api/payments/summary` - Get payment summary statistics
- `GET /api/payments/order/{order_id}` - Get payment status for a specific order

#### Order Routes (`app/routes/order_routes.py`)
Updated existing order endpoints to handle payment types:

- `POST /api/orders/` - Create order with payment type
- `PUT /api/orders/{order_id}` - Update order payment type

#### Invoice Routes (`app/routes/invoice_routes.py`)
Updated invoice endpoints to handle payment types:

- `POST /api/invoices/` - Create invoice with payment type
- `PUT /api/invoices/{invoice_id}` - Update invoice payment type

### 6. Database Migrations

Created migration scripts to update the database schema:

- `0012_add_payment_type_to_orders.py` - Add payment_type column to orders table
- `0013_add_payment_type_to_invoices.py` - Add payment_type column to invoices table
- `0014_add_payment_status_fields.py` - Add additional payment status fields to orders table

## Implementation Details

### Payment Processing Flow

1. **Order Creation**: Customer places an order with a specified payment type
2. **Payment Processing**: Payment is processed through the payment service
3. **Validation**: System validates payment type and amount
4. **Processing Simulation**: For payment methods requiring external processing, the system simulates the processing (in production, this would connect to actual payment processors)
5. **Order Update**: Order is updated with payment information
6. **Invoice Creation**: Invoice is automatically created if one doesn't exist
7. **Confirmation**: Payment confirmation is returned to the client

### Refund Processing Flow

1. **Refund Request**: Customer or staff requests a refund for a paid order
2. **Validation**: System validates that the order was paid and not already refunded
3. **Refund Processing**: Refund is processed based on the original payment method
4. **Order Update**: Order and invoice are updated with refund information
5. **Confirmation**: Refund confirmation is returned to the client

### Payment Summary Generation

The system can generate payment summaries with:
- Total revenue
- Total transaction count
- Breakdown by payment type
- Date range filtering

## API Usage Examples

### Creating an Order with Payment Type
```json
{
  "order": [
    {
      "name": "Burger",
      "price": 8.99,
      "category": "Main Course"
    }
  ],
  "total": 8.99,
  "customer_name": "John Doe",
  "payment_type": "card"
}
```

### Processing a Payment
```json
{
  "order_id": 123,
  "payment_type": "card",
  "amount": 8.99,
  "payment_details": {
    "card_type": "Visa",
    "last_four": "1234"
  }
}
```

### Getting Payment Summary
```json
{
  "start_date": "2025-10-01T00:00:00",
  "end_date": "2025-10-01T23:59:59"
}
```

## Security Features

- All payment endpoints require authentication
- Payment type validation prevents invalid payment methods
- Proper error handling for payment processing failures
- Secure storage of payment references (no sensitive data stored)

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive tests:

- Unit tests for payment service methods
- Integration tests for payment routes
- Validation tests for payment types
- Error handling tests

## Validation & Error Handling

- Invalid payment types automatically default to "cash"
- Payment amount validation ensures it matches order total
- Proper error responses for failed payment operations
- Refund validation prevents duplicate refunds

## Conclusion

The payment functionality has been successfully implemented with:

✅ Full support for multiple payment methods
✅ Proper database schema design
✅ Comprehensive API support
✅ Robust validation and error handling
✅ Full documentation
✅ Extensive testing
✅ Backward compatibility

This implementation provides a solid foundation for handling payments in the restaurant management system with room for future enhancements such as integration with real payment processors.
