# Payment Types Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of support for multiple payment types in the restaurant management system. The system now supports five different payment methods:
- Cash
- Credit/Debit Card
- QR Code Payment
- Electronic Wallet (E-Wallet)
- Gift Card

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Models

#### Order Model (`app/models/order.py`)
- Added `PaymentType` enum with values: `CASH`, `CARD`, `QR`, `E_WALLET`, `GIFT_CARD`
- Added `payment_type` field to the Order model as an Enum column with default value `PaymentType.CASH`

#### Invoice Model (`app/models/invoice.py`)
- Added `payment_type` field to the Invoice model as a String column with default value `"cash"`

### 2. Pydantic Schemas

#### Order Schemas (`app/schemas/order_schema.py`)
- Added `payment_type` field to `OrderBase` schema with default value `"cash"`
- Added `payment_type` field to `OrderUpdate` schema as optional

#### Invoice Schemas (`app/schemas/invoice_schema.py`)
- Added `payment_type` field to `InvoiceBase` schema with default value `"cash"`
- Added `payment_type` field to `InvoiceUpdate` schema as optional

### 3. API Routes

#### Order Routes (`app/routes/order_routes.py`)
- Updated `create_order` endpoint to accept and validate payment_type
- Updated `update_order` endpoint to accept and validate payment_type
- Added validation to ensure only valid payment types are accepted

#### Invoice Routes (`app/routes/invoice_routes.py`)
- Updated `create_invoice` endpoint to accept and validate payment_type
- Updated `update_invoice` endpoint to accept and validate payment_type
- Added validation to ensure only valid payment types are accepted

### 4. Services

#### Invoice Service (`app/services/invoice_service.py`)
- Updated `create_invoice_from_order` method to inherit payment type from the associated order

### 5. Database Migrations

#### Migration Scripts
- Created migration `0012_add_payment_type_to_orders.py` to add payment_type column to orders table
- Created migration `0013_add_payment_type_to_invoices.py` to add payment_type column to invoices table

### 6. Documentation

#### API Documentation (`API_DOCUMENTATION.md`)
- Updated API documentation to include payment_type information for order and invoice endpoints

#### Feature Documentation (`PAYMENT_TYPES.md`)
- Created comprehensive documentation for the payment types feature

## Validation

The implementation includes validation for payment types:
- Only valid payment types are accepted
- Invalid payment types default to "cash"
- Payment types are properly inherited from orders when creating invoices

## Testing

Created unit tests to verify:
- Creating orders with different payment types
- Updating order payment types
- Invalid payment types defaulting to cash
- Invoices inheriting payment types from orders

## Supported Payment Types

| Payment Type | Value      | Description                  |
|--------------|------------|------------------------------|
| Cash         | `cash`     | Physical cash payment        |
| Card         | `card`     | Credit/debit card payment    |
| QR Code      | `qr`       | QR code payment              |
| E-Wallet     | `e_wallet` | Electronic wallet payment    |
| Gift Card    | `gift_card`| Gift card payment            |

## API Usage Examples

### Creating an Order with Payment Type
```json
{
  "order": [
    {
      "name": "Burger",
      "price": 8.99,
      "category": "Main Course"
    }
  ],
  "total": 8.99,
  "payment_type": "card"
}
```

### Updating an Order's Payment Type
```json
{
  "payment_type": "qr"
}
```

### Creating an Invoice with Payment Type
```json
{
  "order_id": 123,
  "customer_name": "John Doe",
  "order_type": "dine_in",
  "subtotal": 8.99,
  "total": 8.99,
  "invoice_items": [
    {
      "name": "Burger",
      "category": "Main Course",
      "price": 8.99,
      "quantity": 1
    }
  ],
  "payment_type": "card"
}
```

## Conclusion

The payment types feature has been successfully implemented with proper validation, database migrations, and documentation. The system now supports multiple payment methods, providing flexibility for different customer preferences and business requirements.
