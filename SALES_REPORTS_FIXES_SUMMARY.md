# Sales Reports Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Unit Test Mock Data Issues
**Problem**: The unit tests for weekly and monthly sales reports were failing because the mock data was not correctly structured.

**Root Cause**: 
- The tests were mocking `week` and `month` fields as strings ("2023-01") instead of datetime objects
- The AnalyticsService implementation expects datetime objects from the database query results
- When the service tried to process the mocked string data, it failed and returned empty arrays

**Fix**: Updated the unit tests to use proper datetime objects for the mock data:
```python
# Before (incorrect)
mock_result.week = "2023-01"
mock_result.month = "2023-01"

# After (correct)
mock_result.week = datetime.now()  # datetime object
mock_result.month = datetime.now()  # datetime object
```

### 2. Integration Test Results
**Status**: All integration tests are now passing correctly
- Daily reports: 8.99 sales, 1 order
- Weekly reports: 8.99 sales, 1 order  
- Monthly reports: 8.99 sales, 1 order

### 3. Import Path Issues
**Status**: Resolved - All imports are working correctly

## Implementation Verification

The AnalyticsService implementation is working correctly:
1. **Daily Reports**: Using `func.date()` for grouping by day
2. **Weekly Reports**: Using `func.date_trunc('week', Order.created_at)` for grouping by week
3. **Monthly Reports**: Using `func.date_trunc('month', Order.created_at)` for grouping by month

All functions are using PostgreSQL-compatible date functions.
