# FastAPI Backend Template FAQ

Frequently Asked Questions about the FastAPI backend template.

## üì¶ General Questions

### What is this FastAPI backend template?

This is a production-ready template for building web APIs with FastAPI. It includes:
- User authentication with JWT tokens
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- PostgreSQL database integration
- SQLAlchemy ORM
- Alembic database migrations
- Docker containerization
- Development and production configurations
- Example user seeding
- Comprehensive testing setup

### Why should I use this template?

This template provides a solid foundation for building scalable, secure web APIs with Python and FastAPI. It includes best practices for:
- Security (password hashing, JWT authentication)
- Database management (migrations, ORM)
- Containerization (Docker, Docker Compose)
- Development workflow (hot reload, testing)
- Project structure (separation of concerns)

### What are the system requirements?

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git
- At least 4GB RAM (recommended)

### How do I customize this template for my project?

1. Clone the repository
2. Modify the models in `app/models/`
3. Update the schemas in `app/schemas/`
4. Add business logic in `app/services/`
5. Create new API endpoints in `app/routes/`
6. Update the database migrations
7. Customize the environment variables

## üê≥ Docker Questions

### How do I run the application in development mode?

```bash
make dev
```

This starts the application with hot reload enabled, so code changes are reflected immediately.

### How do I run the application in production mode?

```bash
make prod
```

This starts the application with Gunicorn workers for better performance.

### How do I stop the application?

```bash
make down
```

To also remove the database volume (losing all data):

```bash
make down -v
```

### Can I run the application without Docker?

Yes, but it requires manual setup:
1. Install Python 3.9+
2. Install PostgreSQL
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Set environment variables
5. Run migrations: `alembic -c app/migrations/alembic.ini upgrade head`
6. Start the server: `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`

## üîê Authentication Questions

### How does authentication work?

1. Users register with email and password
2. Password is hashed using bcrypt before storage
3. Users login with email and password
4. Password is verified against the hashed version
5. JWT token is generated and returned
6. Client includes token in Authorization header for protected routes
7. Server validates token and extracts user information

### How do I register a new user?

Send a POST request to `/users/register` with:
```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "securepassword"
}
```

### How do I login?

Send a POST request to `/users/login` with:
```json
{
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "securepassword"
}
```

The response will include an access token.

### How do I access protected routes?

Include the access token in the Authorization header:
```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE
```

### How long do tokens last?

By default, tokens expire after 60 minutes. This can be configured with the `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES` environment variable.

### How do I change the secret key?

Set the `SECRET_KEY` environment variable in your `.env` file.

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Questions

### What database does this template use?

PostgreSQL is used by default, but the template can be adapted for other databases supported by SQLAlchemy.

### How do I run database migrations?

```bash
make migrate
```

Or manually:
```bash
docker-compose exec web alembic -c app/migrations/alembic.ini upgrade head
```

### How do I create a new migration?

```bash
docker-compose exec web alembic -c app/migrations/alembic.ini revision --autogenerate -m "Description of changes"
```

### How do I add a new table?

1. Create a new model in `app/models/`
2. Create a migration:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec web alembic -c app/migrations/alembic.ini revision --autogenerate -m "Add new table"
   ```
3. Apply the migration:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec web alembic -c app/migrations/alembic.ini upgrade head
   ```

### Is there sample data?

Yes, an example user is automatically created:
- Email: `user@example.com`
- Password: `password123`

## üß™ Testing Questions

### How do I run tests?

```bash
make test
```

Or:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/
```

### What types of tests are included?

- Unit tests for user service functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Tests for both SQLite (in-memory) and PostgreSQL

### How do I add new tests?

1. Create a new test file in the `tests/` directory
2. Follow the existing test patterns
3. Run tests to verify they work

### How do I run specific tests?

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_users.py
python -m pytest tests/test_users.py::test_create_user
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Questions

### How do I add a new API endpoint?

1. Create a new route file in `app/routes/` or add to an existing one
2. Define the endpoint with appropriate decorators
3. Implement the business logic in `app/services/`
4. Add necessary models and schemas
5. Include the router in `app/main.py`

### How do I add a new dependency?

1. Add the dependency to `requirements.txt`

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],  # Configure appropriately for production
    allow_credentials=True,
