# Sales Reports Feature Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the daily/weekly/monthly sales reports feature for the FastAPI backend.

## Feature Overview

The sales reports feature provides restaurant managers and administrators with detailed insights into sales performance through three types of reports:
- Daily sales reports
- Weekly sales reports
- Monthly sales reports

All reports include total sales, order counts, and average order values for the specified period.

## Implementation Details

### 1. New Pydantic Schemas

Created new schemas in [app/schemas/analytics_schema.py](file://app/schemas/analytics_schema.py):
- `SalesReportItem` - Represents individual data points in sales reports
- `DailySalesReportResponse` - Response model for daily sales reports
- `WeeklySalesReportResponse` - Response model for weekly sales reports
- `MonthlySalesReportResponse` - Response model for monthly sales reports

### 2. Analytics Service Methods

Added new methods to [app/services/analytics_service.py](file://app/services/analytics_service.py):
- `get_daily_sales_report()` - Generates daily sales reports
- `get_weekly_sales_report()` - Generates weekly sales reports
- `get_monthly_sales_report()` - Generates monthly sales reports

Each method:
- Accepts optional start_date and end_date parameters
- Queries the database for sales data grouped by the appropriate time period
- Calculates totals and averages
- Returns structured response objects

### 3. New API Endpoints

Added new endpoints in [app/routes/analytics_routes.py](file://app/routes/analytics_routes.py):
- `GET /api/analytics/reports/daily` - Retrieve daily sales report
- `GET /api/analytics/reports/weekly` - Retrieve weekly sales report
- `GET /api/analytics/reports/monthly` - Retrieve monthly sales report

All endpoints:
- Require authentication
- Are only accessible by users with MANAGER or ADMIN roles
- Accept optional start_date and end_date query parameters
- Return structured JSON responses with sales data

### 4. Documentation Updates

Updated documentation files:
- [ANALYTICS_API.md](file://ANALYTICS_API.md) - Added detailed documentation for new endpoints
- [API_DOCUMENTATION.md](file://API_DOCUMENTATION.md) - Added endpoint references to main API documentation
- [PROJECT_SUMMARY.md](file://PROJECT_SUMMARY.md) - Updated feature list
- [README.md](file://README.md) - Updated feature list and endpoint list

### 5. Test Files

Created new test files:
- [tests/test_sales_reports.py](file://tests/test_sales_reports.py) - Integration tests for sales report endpoints
- [tests/test_sales_reports_unit.py](file://tests/test_sales_reports_unit.py) - Unit tests for sales report functionality
- Updated [test_analytics.py](file://test_analytics.py) - Added tests for new endpoints

## API Usage Examples

### Daily Sales Report
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8088/api/analytics/reports/daily" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

### Weekly Sales Report with Date Filters
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8088/api/analytics/reports/weekly?start_date=2023-01-01&end_date=2023-01-31" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

### Monthly Sales Report
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8088/api/analytics/reports/monthly" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

## Response Format

### Daily Sales Report Response
```json
{
  "period": "daily",
  "start_date": "2023-01-01T00:00:00",
  "end_date": "2023-01-31T00:00:00",
  "total_sales": 25000.00,
  "total_orders": 500,
  "average_daily_sales": 806.45,
  "sales_data": [
    {
      "date": "2023-01-01T00:00:00",
      "total_sales": 1200.50,
      "order_count": 25,
      "average_order_value": 48.02
    }
  ]
}
```

## Security

All sales report endpoints:
- Require valid JWT authentication
- Are restricted to MANAGER and ADMIN roles only
- Follow the same security patterns as existing analytics endpoints

## Testing

The implementation includes:
- Unit tests for service methods with mock database queries
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Updated existing analytics tests to include new endpoints

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
1. Enhanced date grouping with actual date calculations for weeks and months
2. Additional filtering options (by employee, table, menu category)
3. Export functionality (CSV, Excel)
4. Visualization data formats
5. Real-time analytics with WebSocket support
