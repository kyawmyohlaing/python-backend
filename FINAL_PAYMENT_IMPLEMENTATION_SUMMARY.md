# Final Payment Functionality Implementation Summary

## Overview

The payment functionality has been successfully implemented in the FastAPI backend restaurant management system. This implementation provides comprehensive payment processing capabilities with support for multiple payment methods.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Payment Service (`app/services/payment_service.py`)
- **Location**: `app/services/payment_service.py`
- **Purpose**: Central service for handling all payment-related operations
- **Key Features**:
  - Payment processing for orders
  - Refund processing for paid orders
  - Payment method validation
  - Payment summary generation
  - Payment method information retrieval

### 2. Payment Routes (`app/routes/payment_routes.py`)
- **Location**: `app/routes/payment_routes.py`
- **Purpose**: RESTful API endpoints for payment operations
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/payments/process` - Process payments
  - `POST /api/payments/refund` - Process refunds
  - `GET /api/payments/methods` - Get available payment methods
  - `POST /api/payments/summary` - Get payment summaries
  - `GET /api/payments/order/{order_id}` - Get order payment status

### 3. Payment Schemas (`app/schemas/payment_schema.py`)
- **Location**: `app/schemas/payment_schema.py`
- **Purpose**: Pydantic models for request/response validation
- **Models**:
  - `PaymentProcessRequest`/`PaymentProcessResponse`
  - `RefundProcessRequest`/`RefundProcessResponse`
  - `PaymentSummaryRequest`/`PaymentSummaryResponse`
  - And more...

### 4. Model Enhancements (`app/models/order.py`)
- **Location**: `app/models/order.py`
- **Purpose**: Enhanced Order model with payment-related fields
- **New Fields**:
  - `payment_status` - Payment status tracking
  - `paid_at` - Payment timestamp
  - `payment_reference` - Payment processor reference
  - `refund_status` - Refund status tracking
  - `refunded_at` - Refund timestamp

### 5. Database Migration (`app/migrations/versions/0014_add_payment_status_fields.py`)
- **Location**: `app/migrations/versions/0014_add_payment_status_fields.py`
- **Purpose**: Alembic migration to add new payment fields to orders table

### 6. API Documentation
- **Location**: `PAYMENT_API.md`
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive documentation for payment API endpoints

### 7. Integration Updates
- **Location**: `app/main.py`
- **Purpose**: Integration of payment routes into main application
