# Order Status Extension Documentation

This document explains the implementation of the "served" status in the order management system, completing the requested flow: "Pending → Preparing → Ready → Served".

## Overview

The order status tracking system has been extended to include a fourth status: "served". This status represents the final stage in the order lifecycle, indicating that an order has been delivered to the customer and all associated resources have been released.

## Status Flow

The complete order status flow is now:
```
Pending → Preparing → Ready → Served
```

Each status represents a specific stage in the order lifecycle:
- **Pending**: Order has been submitted but not yet started
- **Preparing**: Kitchen staff are preparing the order
- **Ready**: Order is ready for serving
- **Served**: Order has been delivered to the customer

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

1. **Model Updates**:
   - Updated the KitchenOrder model to include "served" as a valid status option
   - The status field now accepts: "pending", "preparing", "ready", "served"

2. **API Endpoint Updates**:
   - Enhanced the existing `/api/kitchen/orders/{order_id}` PUT endpoint to accept "served" as a valid status
   - Added validation to ensure only valid statuses are accepted
   - Added a new `/api/kitchen/orders/{order_id}/mark-served` endpoint for explicitly marking orders as served
   - Added a new `/api/orders/{order_id}/mark-served` endpoint for marking orders as served from the general order management perspective
   - Added a new `/api/orders/{order_id}/status` endpoint for updating order status

3. **Resource Management**:
   - When an order is marked as "served", associated resources are automatically released:
     - For dine-in orders, the assigned table is marked as available
     - All seats at the table are released
     - The table's current_order_id is cleared

### Frontend Integration

The frontend OrderStatusTracker component already supports the "served" status and will automatically display orders with this status in the appropriate section.

## API Usage Examples

### Update Order Status to Served

```bash
# Using the kitchen API
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8088/api/kitchen/orders/1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status": "served"}'

# Using the general order API
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8088/api/orders/1/status \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status": "served"}'
```

### Mark Order as Served (Alternative Endpoint)

```bash
# Using the kitchen API
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/kitchen/orders/1/mark-served

# Using the general order API
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/orders/1/mark-served
```

## Validation

The system includes validation to ensure:
1. Only valid statuses ("pending", "preparing", "ready", "served") are accepted
2. Status transitions follow the defined flow (though the API allows direct transitions for flexibility)
3. Associated resources are properly released when orders are marked as served

## Testing

The implementation has been tested to ensure:
1. Orders can be successfully marked as "served"
2. Resource cleanup occurs correctly for dine-in orders
3. API responses are consistent with other status updates
4. Error handling works properly for invalid requests

## Integration with Existing Systems

This extension maintains full backward compatibility with existing systems:
- Existing kitchen displays will show "served" orders in their respective sections
- The frontend OrderStatusTracker component already supports the new status
- All existing API endpoints continue to function as before

## Future Considerations

Potential future enhancements could include:
1. Status transition rules to enforce linear progression
2. Audit logging for status changes
3. Notifications when orders are marked as served
4. Analytics on order completion times
