# Staff Roles Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of staff logins with roles (waiter, cashier, manager, chef) in the FastAPI backend.

## Implementation Overview

We have successfully implemented a role-based access control system that supports the following staff roles:
- Waiter
- Cashier
- Manager
- Chef
- Admin
- Kitchen
- Bar

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Updated User Schema ([app/schemas/user_schema.py](file:///c%3A/strategy_test/python_backend_structure/app/schemas/user_schema.py))

- Added `UserRole` enum with all required roles
- Modified `UserCreate` schema to include optional `role` field (defaults to "waiter")
- Updated `UserResponse` schema to include `role` field
- Added `role` field to `UserUpdate` schema

### 2. Updated User Model ([app/models/user.py](file:///c%3A/strategy_test/python_backend_structure/app/models/user.py))

- Extended `UserRole` enum to include all required roles:
  - ADMIN
  - WAITER
  - CASHIER
  - MANAGER
  - CHEF
  - KITCHEN
  - BAR

### 3. Updated User Service ([app/services/user_service.py](file:///c%3A/strategy_test/python_backend_structure/app/services/user_service.py))

- Modified `create_user` method to handle role assignment during user creation

### 4. Updated User Routes ([app/routes/user_routes.py](file:///c%3A/strategy_test/python_backend_structure/app/routes/user_routes.py))

- Added proper import for `UserUpdate` schema
- Ensured all user endpoints properly handle roles

### 5. Added Role-Based Access Control Dependencies ([app/dependencies.py](file:///c%3A/strategy_test/python_backend_structure/app/dependencies.py))

- Added `require_role` dependency for enforcing specific role access
- Added `require_any_role` dependency for enforcing access based on multiple roles

### 6. Updated Database Initialization ([init_postgres.py](file:///c%3A/strategy_test/python_backend_structure/init_postgres.py))

- Added sample users with different roles for testing:
  - Admin user
  - Waiter user
  - Cashier user
  - Manager user
  - Chef user

### 7. Created Supporting Files

- Role-based access control documentation ([ROLE_BASED_ACCESS.md](file:///c%3A/strategy_test/python_backend_structure/ROLE_BASED_ACCESS.md))
- Example script demonstrating role-based access ([examples/role_based_access.py](file:///c%3A/strategy_test/python_backend_structure/examples/role_based_access.py))
- Unit tests for role functionality ([tests/test_user_roles.py](file:///c%3A/strategy_test/python_backend_structure/tests/test_user_roles.py))

## API Usage

### Register a New User with Role

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/users/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "password": "securepassword",
    "role": "manager"
  }'
```

### Login

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/users/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "password": "securepassword"
  }'
```

### Get Current User (Includes Role)

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/users/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE"
```

## Role-Based Endpoint Protection

Developers can protect endpoints based on roles using the provided dependencies:

```python
from fastapi import Depends
from app.dependencies import require_role, require_any_role
from app.schemas.user_schema import UserRole

# Only managers can access
@app.get("/manager-dashboard")
def manager_dashboard(current_user: User = Depends(require_role(UserRole.MANAGER))):
    return {"message": "Manager dashboard"}

# Multiple roles can access
@app.get("/staff-area")
def staff_area(current_user: User = Depends(require_any_role([UserRole.WAITER, UserRole.CASHIER, UserRole.MANAGER]))):
    return {"message": "Staff area"}
```

## Testing

The implementation has been tested and verified to work correctly. You can run the tests with:

```bash
python test_role_implementation.py
```

## Sample Users for Testing

The system includes the following sample users for testing purposes:

| Username | Email | Password | Role |
|----------|-------|----------|------|
| admin | admin@example.com | admin123 | admin |
| waiter | waiter@example.com | waiter123 | waiter |
| cashier | cashier@example.com | cashier123 | cashier |
| manager | manager@example.com | manager123 | manager |
| chef | chef@example.com | chef123 | chef |

## Conclusion

The staff login system with role-based access control has been successfully implemented. The system allows for fine-grained access control based on user roles and provides a solid foundation for building more complex permission systems in the future.
