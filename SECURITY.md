## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within this project, please send an email to [security@your-domain.com](mailto:security@your-domain.com) instead of using the public issue tracker. All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.

Please include the following information in your email:

1. **Description**: A clear and concise description of the vulnerability
2. **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability
3. **Impact**: Explanation of the potential impact
4. **Environment**: The environment where the vulnerability was discovered
5. **Attachments**: Any relevant screenshots, logs, or proof-of-concept code

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly update dependencies to the latest secure versions
2. **Use Strong Secrets**: Generate strong, random secrets for `SECRET_KEY` and database passwords
3. **Environment Variables**: Store secrets in environment variables, not in code
4. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production
5. **Database Security**: Use strong database passwords and limit database user permissions
6. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
7. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for public endpoints
8. **Logging**: Monitor logs for suspicious activity

### For Developers

1. **Dependency Management**: 
   - Regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities
   - Use tools like `safety` to check for insecure dependencies
   - Pin dependency versions in production

2. **Authentication & Authorization**:
   - Never store passwords in plain text
   - Use strong password hashing (bcrypt)
   - Implement proper JWT token validation
   - Use secure random number generation for tokens

3. **Input Validation**:
   - Validate all user inputs using Pydantic schemas
   - Sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks
   - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
   - Log security-related events
   - Implement proper error handling

5. **Docker Security**:
   - Use official base images
   - Run containers as non-root users
   - Keep base images updated
   - Scan images for vulnerabilities

## 🔍 Security Audits

We recommend performing regular security audits of your deployment:

1. **Dependency Scanning**: Use tools like `safety` or `bandit` to scan for vulnerabilities
2. **Container Scanning**: Use tools like Clair or Trivy to scan Docker images
3. **Penetration Testing**: Regularly perform penetration testing
4. **Code Review**: Conduct security-focused code reviews

## 🛠️ Security Tools

### Dependency Security

```bash
# Install safety
pip install safety

# Check for insecure dependencies
safety check -r requirements.txt
```

### Code Security

```bash
# Install bandit
pip install bandit

# Scan for common security issues
bandit -r app/
```

### Docker Image Security

```bash
# Using Trivy (requires installation)
trivy image your-image-name
```
